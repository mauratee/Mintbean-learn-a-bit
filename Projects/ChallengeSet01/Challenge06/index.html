  Level up bit by bit with Learn-a-bit
  
  As the name says, the purpose of
  Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit
  of code at a time. In these events,
  you will build small projects to
  educate yourself on the fundamentals
  of web development using HTML, CSS,
  and JavaScript. These events are
  relaxed and non-competitive, but are
  still chalennging enough to push you
  to use all your resources and
  knowledge to solve each problem.

  What is it about?

  What is learn-a-bit about?

  Learn-a-bit will teach you the fundamentals through a hands-on approach. You
  will gain versatility in the basic tools of the trade and learn the best
  practices for writing semantic HTML and well-designed CSS. You will improve
  your design skills and start to create attractive and attention-grabbing
  portfolio pieces while also gaining confidence to tackle any of the harder
  hackathons. 
  
  In the end, the first impression and presentation of products
  are the main reason for its success and appeal. Our products represent
  ourselves and our knowledge so we should make it shine in the best light.
